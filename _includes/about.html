<h3>About J-Rock</h3>
<p>J-Rock’s ice creams are made by Jared Rizzo, born and raised in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn. Growing up in a food-obsessed family (first-generation Italian-Americans), Jared’s favorite activity has always been exploring the many cuisines throughout the borough, with a life-long love of ice cream. In 2014, some renegade chicken stock led Jared to start making ice cream of his own. After an allergic reaction to poultry, Jared was unable to eat solid food for more than six months (a true nightmare for his Italian grandmother). Left with only soup and ice cream, he started experimenting with different tastes and flavors, which led to the creation of many of the unique ice creams available today. He’s better now (phew!), and is excited to share his love of ice cream with New York City.</p>
